# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler Challenge

## Description
This challenge requires a deployed daily planner that would allow a user to create a schedule. The current day should be displayed at the top of the calendar when a user opens it. As a user scrolls down the planner display, the user is presented with timeblocks for standard business hours of 9am and 5pm. When a user views the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock will be color coded to indicate whether that block is in the past, present, or future. IF a user clicks into a timeblock, the user can enter an event. The user should have the information saved when the save button is clicked for that timeblock and that event is saved in local storage. When the page is refreshed all events should persist.
